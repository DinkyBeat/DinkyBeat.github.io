<h1>Problems I am interested in (2026)</h1>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr1 (DeterministicFactorization).</b>
Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field and $f(x)\in\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ a nonconstant polynomial.
Randomized algorithms of Berlekamp and Cantor--Zassenhaus factor $f(x)$ in time polynomial in $\deg f$ and $\log q$.
It is unknown whether there exists a <em>deterministic</em> algorithm that factors arbitrary polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ in polynomial time without relying on unproven hypotheses, and even restricted structural families remain poorly understood.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr2 (StanleyDepth).</b>
For a monomial ideal $I\subset S=k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, one defines the combinatorial invariant $\operatorname{sdepth}(I)$ (Stanley depth) via Stanley decompositions, while $\operatorname{depth}(I)$ is the homological depth.
Although these invariants arise from very different constructions, no general inequality relating them is known in full generality, and whether
\[
\operatorname{sdepth}(I)\ge \operatorname{depth}(I)
\]
holds for all monomial ideals remains unresolved.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr3 (ReflexiveUnimodality).</b>
Let $P\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be a reflexive lattice polytope and write its Ehrhart series as
\[
\sum_{m\ge0} |mP\cap\mathbb{Z}^d|\,t^m=\frac{h^*(t)}{(1-t)^{d+1}},
\]
where $h^*(t)=h_0^*+h_1^*t+\cdots+h_d^*t^d$.
The coefficients form a symmetric vector, but it is unknown whether the sequence $(h_i^*)$ must always be unimodal.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr4 (IDPUnimodality).</b>
A lattice polytope $P$ has the integer decomposition property (IDP) if every lattice point of $mP$ decomposes as a sum of $m$ lattice points of $P$.
The associated semigroup algebra is normal, yet it is unknown whether IDP implies unimodality of the Ehrhart $h^*$-vector or other strong positivity properties.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr5 (WilfSemigroup).</b>
Let $S=\langle a_1,\dots,a_e\rangle\subset\mathbb{N}$ be a numerical semigroup with Frobenius number $F$ and genus $g=|\mathbb{N}\setminus S|$.
Wilf's conjecture asserts that
\[
F+1\le e\,g.
\]
Despite verification in many cases, no general proof or counterexample is known.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr6 (CasasAlvero).</b>
Let $f(x)\in k[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ over a field of characteristic $0$.
If $\gcd(f,f^{(i)})\neq1$ for every derivative $1\le i\le n-1$, must $f(x)$ be a pure power $(x-a)^n$?
This deceptively elementary condition defines a highly constrained algebraic locus whose global structure is not understood.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr7 (ZariskiCancellation).</b>
Let $k$ be a field and $A$ a finitely generated $k$-algebra.
If
\[
A[t]\cong k[x_1,\dots,x_{n+1}]
\]
as $k$-algebras, must $A\cong k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$?
This is the Zariski Cancellation Problem, solved in low dimensions but open or subtle in many geometric settings.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr8 (RationalVsUnirational).</b>
A projective variety $X$ over $k$ is unirational if there exists a dominant rational map $\mathbb{P}^n\dashrightarrow X$, and rational if it is birational to $\mathbb{P}^n$.
Although rational $\Rightarrow$ unirational, the converse is poorly understood in higher dimensions, and explicit separating examples remain difficult to construct.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr9 (NagataInterpolation).</b>
Given general points $p_1,\dots,p_r\in\mathbb{P}^2$ with multiplicities $m_i$, determine the minimal degree $d$ for which there exists a plane curve of degree $d$ vanishing to order $m_i$ at each $p_i$.
Nagata predicted precise asymptotic bounds, but the conjecture is open except in special cases.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr10 (GroupRingTorsion).</b>
Let $G$ be a finite group and consider the unit group of the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$.
The Zassenhaus conjecture predicts that every torsion unit is conjugate in $\mathbb{Q}[G]$ to an element of $G$, yet this remains unresolved in general.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr11 (GenericInitialIdeals).</b>
For a homogeneous ideal $I\subset k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, the generic initial ideal $\mathrm{gin}(I)$ encodes asymptotic behavior under coordinate changes.
Even for ideals generated by two general forms, there is no closed description of $\mathrm{gin}(I)$ or its Betti numbers.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr12 (CellularResolutions).</b>
Many monomial ideals admit minimal free resolutions supported on CW-complexes.
It is unknown which classes of ideals always admit such <em>cellular resolutions</em>, and no intrinsic characterization of this property is known.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr13 (gConjectureSpheres).</b>
The $g$-conjecture predicts necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence to occur as the $h$-vector of a simplicial sphere.
While proven for polytopes, the general topological case remains open.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr14 (PermutationBinomials).</b>
A polynomial $f(x)\in\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is a permutation polynomial if it induces a bijection of $\mathbb{F}_q$.
Determining when sparse polynomials such as $x^a+cx^b$ have this property is known only in scattered families.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr15 (SparsePermutationPolynomials).</b>
For trinomials and quadrinomials over finite fields, no classification exists describing when they define permutations.
Their behavior appears governed by subtle arithmetic relations among exponents.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr16 (AlmostCompleteIntersectionHilbert).</b>
If $I=(f_1,\dots,f_{c+1})$ in a polynomial ring has codimension $c$, then $I$ is an almost complete intersection.
The possible Hilbert functions and graded Betti tables of such ideals lack a structural classification.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr17 (SymbolicEquality).</b>
For an ideal $I\subset R$, the symbolic power
\[
I^{(m)}=\bigcap_{\mathfrak{p}\in\mathrm{Min}(I)}(I^mR_{\mathfrak{p}}\cap R)
\]
often differs from the ordinary power $I^m$.
Determining when equality holds is a central unresolved question in the theory of singularities and blowups.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr18 (SymbolicContainment).</b>
Given integers $m,r$, determining when the containment
\[
I^{(m)}\subseteq I^r
\]
holds is known only through partial bounds (e.g.\ Ein--Lazarsfeld--Smith, Hochster--Huneke).
Sharp criteria depending on the geometry of $\mathrm{Spec}(R/I)$ are unknown.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr19 (RegularityAsymptotics).</b>
For a homogeneous ideal $I$, the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity satisfies
\[
\mathrm{reg}(I^m)=am+b
\]
for $m\gg0$.
While asymptotic linearity is known, there is no general method to determine $a$ or $b$ from the generators of $I$.
</div>

<div class="problem">
<b>Pr20 (ReesEquations).</b>
The Rees algebra
\[
\mathcal{R}(I)=\bigoplus_{m\ge0} I^m t^m
\]
controls the blowup of $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ along $V(I)$.
Even for simple ideals, describing defining equations, depth, or Cohen--Macaulayness of $\mathcal{R}(I)$ is widely open.
</div>
